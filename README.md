# Practice Activity 1: Adventure Game with Loops 

## Overview
This is an **optional practice activity** that is designed to help you apply concepts we covered in class so far. Your task for this activity is to create a simple choose-your-own-adventure style game.

> **Important**: This is NOT a required assignment or activity. This is purely for **extra practice** and reinforcement of programming concepts.

## Learning Objectives

**Loop Concepts:**
- Use `for` loops with `range()` function
- Understand loop iteration and counting
- Apply loops for repetitive actions
- Practice nested loops for patterns

**Review Concepts:**
- Variables and data types
- User input and output
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- String formatting
- Basic arithmetic operations

## What You Will Build
A simple adventure game that includes:
- **Character creation** with multiple choices
- **Story progression** using loops for events
- **Pattern generation** for visual elements
- **Decision making** with conditional statements
- **Repetitive actions** using for loops

## Instructions

1. **Start with Examples** - Look at the example files first
2. **Build Your Game** - Complete `adventure_game.py`
3. **Test Frequently** - Run your program as you build it
4. **Experiment** - Try your own creative additions!

## Assessment
- **No grades** - this is purely for practice
- **Self-directed** - work at your own pace
- **Optional** - skip if you are comfortable with the concepts
- **Ask for help** - if you want to understand something better

## Why Practice?
- **Reinforcement** - solidify your understanding
- **Creativity** - apply concepts in a fun context
- **Confidence** - build programming skills gradually
- **Preparation** - get ready for more complex projects

**Remember**: This is meant to be enjoyable practice, not stressful work!
